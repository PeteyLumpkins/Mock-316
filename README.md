# Mock-316
A mock of the course webpage of my CSE-316 website. So yeah I basically tried to copy the style of the course website for my fundamentals of software development course (CSE-316). The goal here was to get myself more familiar with working with Javascript, HTML, CSS and navigating the DOM. It's incomplete, but it was a good learning experience for me.
